/**
 * 4. Write a “main” method into the main class. It has a scanner that takes
 * *  user input. Also write the logic that it ask user to “Enter first Number:”,
 * *  “Enter second Number:” “Please enter one of symbol +,-,*, /:” if user
 * *  enter + symbol result like “Addition of 5 and 10 is: 15” and respective for
 * *  other symbols.
 * *  5. With the result it’s also print one more message “Would you like to do
 * *  more calculation Please enter “Y” or “N” :” (Hint use while loop if user
 * *  enter Y program asking the user to enter First Number, and if user enter
 * *  Nprogramme should terminate
